Major analysis included: How rising global temperatures affect the cost of living worldwide and impact of rising temperatures on global crop production. Implemented various stages of software lifecycle, including project planning, CI/CD pipeline creation, GitHub Actions, automated testing, and project deployment.",
      "Point Prevalence Analysis App for Infectious Disease Stewardship: Developed a web application to assist infectious disease specialists in point prevalence analysis and supporting antimicrobial stewardship effort. Interviewed multiple Infectious Diseases Specialists to translate complex medical workflows into app features, enabling streamlined data entry, analysis, and reporting. Facilitated education for non-specialist physicians using RAG using finetuned GPT3.5 Turbo. Utilized Pinecone vector for embeddings. Deployed using a Docker container. Project is still in progress.",
      "ToolAct - X-AI way to understand Time Series Classification: Researched on various intrinsic and post-hoc explainability methods for ML and Deep Learning models. Implemented the whole Feature-Training-Inference (FTI) pipeline for the project. Utilized recent research in X-AI implemented baseline approaches like SHAP to gradient-based approaches for Transformers and LSTMs like attention and weight analysis using DeepLIFT and integrated gradients."
